## About

I’m Eakempreet. I build useful things and focus on solving real problems with clarity and intent.

---

## Focus

I work across C++, Python, and Java, focusing on systems thinking, fundamentals, and building toward intelligent, real-world software.

---

## Mindset

I value ownership, decision making, and execution.
If something can be built better, I’d rather fix it than ignore it.
