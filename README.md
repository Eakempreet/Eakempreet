## About

Hi, I’m Eakempreet (Eakem).  
I like building useful things and understanding problems deeply before solving them. I care about clarity, outcomes, and systems that actually work in the real world.

## Direction

My focus is on strong fundamentals and long-term growth. I work primarily with C++, Python, and Java, and I’m moving toward intelligent systems that connect software with real use cases. I build foundations first, then scale.

## How I Work

I think in terms of structure, reliability, and improvement. I enjoy taking ideas from zero to something real, refining them through feedback, and making them dependable. I prefer responsibility over instructions and execution over talk.

## Mindset

If something is inefficient, broken, or missing, I see it as something that can be designed better. I value problem solving, decision making, and ownership.
