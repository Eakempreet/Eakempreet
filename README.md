## About

I’m Eakempreet. I build useful things and focus on solving real problems with clarity and intent.

## Focus

I work with C++, Python, and Java, building strong fundamentals while moving toward intelligent systems with real-world impact.

## Mindset

I value ownership, decision making, and execution. If something can be built better, I’d rather fix it than ignore it.
